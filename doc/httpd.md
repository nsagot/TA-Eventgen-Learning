# Apache HTTPD Log Entry Documentation

This document explains the structure and fields associated with an Apache HTTPD (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Daemon) log entry in the provided format. Apache HTTPD logs record HTTP requests and responses.

## Apache HTTPD Log Entry Structure

The Apache combined log format `"%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i"` defines the structure of Apache HTTPD (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Daemon) logs and specifies how the log entries are formatted. This format is used to record details of incoming HTTP requests in Apache logs. Below is an explanation of each field in this format:

- `%h`: This represents the client's IP address (host) that made the request. It is the client's IP address.
- `%l`: This is the user's name, usually represented by a hyphen (`-`). It is rarely used in most configurations and is often left unspecified.
- `%u`: It is the username associated with the request. Similar to `%l`, it is usually represented by a hyphen (`-`) if not authenticated.
- `%t`: This is the date and time of the request in the format `DD/MMM/YYYY:HH:MM:SS +/-HHMM`, where "DD" is the day of the month, "MMM" is the abbreviated month, "YYYY" is the year, "HH:MM:SS" is the hour, minutes, and seconds, and "+/-HHMM" is the time zone offset from UTC.
- `\"%r\"`: This is the complete HTTP request line, including the HTTP method, the resource path, and the HTTP version used by the client. For example, "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1".
- `>%s`: This is the HTTP response status code returned to the client. It indicates whether the request was processed successfully (e.g., "200" for OK) or if there were errors (e.g., "404" for Not Found).
- `%b`: This represents the size of the response in bytes. It is the amount of data sent to the client in the HTTP response.
- `\"%{Referer}i\"`: This is the "Referer" field enclosed in double quotes, indicating the page from which the client followed a link to access the current page. It can help track the source of incoming traffic.
- `\"%{User-agent}i\"`: This is the "User-agent" field enclosed in double quotes, and it contains information about the web browser or user agent used by the client to make the request. It may reveal the browser type, operating system, etc.

These fields are commonly used in Apache logs to capture information about server activities, incoming traffic, and other details that are useful for server monitoring and management. You can customize the Apache log format based on your specific requirements using these fields and other configuration directives.
