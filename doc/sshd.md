# SSHD Log Documentation

This document explains the structure and fields associated with SSHD log entries in the provided format. SSHD logs record authentication activity and session events on Linux servers.

These logs are commonly found on bastion hosts, jump servers, and application servers, and are frequently used in security investigations and monitoring.

## SSHD Log Structure

The SSHD log entry is in the following format:

- `Timestamp`: When the event occurred (e.g., Oct 12 14:00:22)
- `Hostname`: The server generating the log (e.g., aurora-backend)
- `Process name and ID`: Usually sshd followed by the process ID in brackets (e.g., sshd[2331])
- `Message type`: Indicates whether the entry is informational, a warning, or an error
- `Event details`: The specific action or event being logged (e.g., authentication result, IP, user, port)

> Note: This dataset is provided without predefined Splunk field extractions. Learners should work with native fields (_time, host, source, sourcetype, _raw) and build their own extractions. Some fields may be partially parsed through Splunkâ€™s KV_MODE extraction.
